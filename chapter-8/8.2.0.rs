/*
Notes:
- A HashMap<K, V> is a unordered collection of keyâ€“value pairs where
    - Each key is unique.
    - Values are looked up by their key using hashing function
    - Keys and values can be any type that implements the required traits (Eq and Hash for keys).

- Hashmaps are fast, unordered and ownership aware (inserts move keys/values) unless borrowed types are used
